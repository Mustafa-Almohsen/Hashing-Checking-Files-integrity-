Hashing-Checking-Files-Integrity:  is a repository dedicated to demonstrating and implementing file integrity checks using hashing algorithms. This repository provides a collection of scripts  that allow users to generate cryptographic hash values for files and verify their integrity by comparing the calculated hashes against reference values. By leveraging hash functions such as MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256,or SHA-512 this project aims to showcase the importance of data integrity verification and provide practical examples for implementing file integrity checks in various applications. Whether you are  a developer, system administrator, or security enthusiast, this repository offers insights and resources to help you understand and apply file integrity checking techniques in your projects. 

IMAGINE you are re in "Helsinki" and need to send a file to someone in "Washington DC". How can you ensure that the file hasn not been intercepted or manipulated by malicious parties during transmission? This is where hashing comes into play. By generating a hash value for the file before sending it and comparing it with the received file is hash value, we can verify the integrity of the data. This helps us detect if any unauthorized changes were made to the file. The provided scripts in this repository enable you to implement such file integrity checks, leveraging hashing algorithms like MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256. Protect your data from tampering and ensure its integrity during transmission.
